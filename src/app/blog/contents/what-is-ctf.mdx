## What is Capture The Flag (CTF)?

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity contests where participants solve security-related challenges to capture digital flags. These competitions are designed to test and improve participants' skills in various areas of cybersecurity, such as cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, and forensics.

## Why CTF Competitions are Important

- **Skill Development**: Provides hands-on experience in solving real-world security challenges.
- **Team Building**: Encourages collaboration and teamwork among participants.
- **Networking**: Offers opportunities to connect with other cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals.
- **Career Advancement**: Enhances your resume and demonstrates your skills to potential employers.

## Types of CTF Competitions

### 1. **Jeopardy-Style CTF**

In Jeopardy-style CTFs, participants solve a series of challenges across different categories. Each challenge has a point value, and teams or individuals earn points by capturing flags. Categories may include:

- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Web Exploitation
- Forensics
- Binary Exploitation

### 2. **Attack-Defense CTF**

In Attack-Defense CTFs, teams are given a network or system to defend while simultaneously trying to attack and capture flags from opponents. This format simulates real-world cyber attack and defense scenarios.

### 3. **Mixed CTF**

Mixed CTFs combine elements of both Jeopardy-style and Attack-Defense formats, offering a variety of challenges and scenarios to solve.
